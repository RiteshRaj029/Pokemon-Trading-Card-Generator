This is a Pokemon Card Generator (1-500) with the card showing pokemon's name, HP , type(s) , image and stats[attack, defense and speed]. 
This is created using the Poke API: "https://pokeapi.co/".
All the data displayed on the card are fetched from this API only.
The images might take some time to display as there is a slow fetch response from the api server.
