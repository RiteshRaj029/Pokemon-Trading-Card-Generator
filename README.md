# Pokemon-Trading-Card-Generator

This is a Pokemon Card Generator (1-100) with the card showing pokemon's name, HP , type(s) , image and stats[attack, defense and speed]. 
This is created using the Poke API: "https://pokeapi.co/".
All the data displayed on the card are fetched from this API only, but for some reason their images are not working are have removed from their original github repository.
So for retrieving images I came up with a website which also used the same Poke API to retrieve the data and have most of the images with them. Thus for the images this website is used : "https://unpkg.com/css-chain-test@1.1.9/src/PokeApi-Explorer.html".
